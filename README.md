# üß† Dynamic Multi-Agent Negotiation Framework

A sophisticated system for creating autonomous, multi-agent debates around user-defined scenarios with real-time visualization and user intervention capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system enables **autonomous, multi-agent debates** where agents communicate, debate, negotiate trade-offs, and reason iteratively to reach consensus. Users can view debates live, intervene at system level, and control agent participation.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Auto-generates N agents with relevant goals and personalities
- **Multi-Agent Debate Engine**: Agents communicate using Google A2A protocol
- **Memory & Context Awareness**: Hierarchical memory system with Redis and ChromaDB
- **Consensus Building**: Advanced voting mechanisms (Borda Count, Delphi Method)
- **Real-Time UI**: Live debate visualization with agent interaction graphs
- **User Intervention System**: Control agent entry, pause/resume debates, manual consensus triggers

| LLM Backend | OpenAI GPT-4 / Claude / Mixtral | Agent reasoning & generation |
| Short-Term Memory | Redis | Active debate state & agent memory |
| Session Memory | ChromaDB | Current debate history & semantic search |
| Agent Orchestration | LangGraph + Google A2A | Multi-agent coordination |
| Frontend | React.js + TailwindCSS | Real-time debate visualization |
| Real-Time Communication | Socket.IO | Live debate streaming |
| Visualization | D3.js / React Flow | Agent interaction graphs |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Redis
- ChromaDB
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-negotiator.git
cd multi-agent-negotiator

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories:

```bash
# Backend .env

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
CHROMA_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_PORT=8000
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```
